## Overview

In this project, we focus on characterizing and mitigating Reentrancy vulnerabilities in Ethereum upgradable smart contracts. These vulnerabilities have led to significant financial losses, most notably in the DAO attack of 2016. By leveraging advanced static and dynamic analysis tools, we aim to enhance the security framework of Ethereum smart contracts.

## Project Background

Ethereum's capability to support smart contracts has been both a strength and a source of security challenges. One of the most notorious vulnerabilities is the Reentrancy attack, which exploits the asynchronous nature of smart contract operations. This project aims to enhance detection and mitigation of these vulnerabilities using a hybrid analysis approach.

### Methodologies

- **Static Analysis**:
  - **Slither**: Utilized for intermediate representation analysis to detect vulnerability patterns.
  - **Mythril**: Applied for symbolic execution to identify potential risks.

- **Dynamic Analysis**:
  - **Sereum**: Used to monitor contract interactions in simulated environments to identify exploitative behaviors.

- **NLP Integration**:
  - Integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to improve the accuracy of vulnerability detection by understanding semantic code patterns.

### Experiment Setup

Our experiment involved a comprehensive analysis of the Ethereum Smart Contracts (ESC) dataset, consisting of over 307,000 smart contract functions. We employed advanced NLP models such as Attention-based BiLSTM-CNN and DeBERTA-v3 to robustly analyze and detect vulnerabilities.

### Key Results

- **Performance Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Models like CGE and Attention-BiLSTM-CNN showed significant improvements over traditional methods.
  - **Recall and Precision**: Enhanced data augmentation methods ensured balanced representation and improved detection of vulnerabilities.
