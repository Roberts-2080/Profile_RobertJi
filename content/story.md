The idea of a 'Story' page is to tell you about how I keep motivated and objective-oriented.

## Story I
Like my practice of engaging with team members in past projects, understanding her background and circumstances was my initial step. Recognizing her potential yet noticing her anxiety towards group presentations, I shared resources I found helpful online to improve public speaking and deliver presentations. I also offered to help her proofread her section and set up additional time with the group to run through some practise presentations. Most importantly, I gave her a lot of positive reinforcement to increase her confidence level, and continuously checked in with her on a weekly basis to ensure she was comfortable and confident with the task assigned.
In the end, she stepped up and delivered her part of the presentation confidently, which was a big progress for herself and the whole group. We got great feedback from our classmates and the lecturers. It was more than just nailing a presentation; it was about her coming into her own in a new environment. And for me, helping her along that journey, making sure it was filled with growth and confidence, that was really the goal.
By doing so, I not only aimed to help her achieve success in the conventional sense but also tried to ensure that her journey was marked by personal growth and self-assurance.
This experience also taught me that how much of a difference you can make in someone's life with a bit of tailored, personal support. It's not always about the big gestures, but sometimes, it's the encouragement, and just being there that can help someone find their footing. That's something I'll carry with me moving forward.
